# Hi there 👋

I'm Peetah (26, he/him) and I'm a computer engineer from Milan, Italy!
I stream over at [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/malimore) and am always learning and creating new stuff!

This is where I mainly keep track of all my coding adventures, but I also have a ton of repos over at [@itsPeetah-archive](https://github.com/itsPeetah-archive) to keep this place clean.

### I'm passionate about:

- Game and web development
- Sharing my knowledge, helping others learn and bringing people together
- Pizza.

## Gamedev 👾

I am on a bit of a gamedev hiatus at the moment, but I make games as **springpunk games** ([GitHub](https://github.com/springpunk) - [Website](https://games.springpunk.net))

My main gamedev channels are the [whateep YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/whateep) and the [Punk Pebble's itch.io page](https://punkpebblestudio.itch.io). Some older repositories I did for whateep content are over at [@whateep](https://github.com/whateep).

## Webdev 🌐

I've been into web development recently and I am a sucker for NextJS, React and TailwindCSS atm.

### Currently working on:

- A boss-rush style movement oriented action game
- Making my Go knowledge better
- Coming up with new ideas

### Some things I have done:

- Many small indie games and games in many different languages
- Learned many different languages and frameworks
- Taught Python Programming at the National Nuclear Physics Institute
- Made multiple free Unity game programming tutorials
